**MuRaL**,  short for **Mu**\ tation **Ra**\ te **L**\ earner, 
is a deep learning framework to predict mutation rates at the 
nucleotide level using only genomic sequences as input. MuRaL 
can build models with relatively few training mutations and 
a moderate number of sequenced individuals (e.g. ~100 individuals), 
and can leverage transfer learning to further reduce data and 
time demands.
